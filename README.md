# Powershell-Encryption-Decryption

This repository contains scripts which can encrypt text into Base64 or decrypt Base64 into normal text. 

## Installation

There is no special installation required. 

Just download the files and open it in your IDE.
I would recommend using Visual Studio Code, because it's a cross-platform script editor by Microsoft and together with the PowerShell extension, it provides a rich and interactive script editing experience, making it easier to write reliable PowerShell scripts.

If you don't have Visual Studio Code, you can open it from the Powershell ISE.

## Usage

### 1. Make sure to have some text in the file 'input.txt'.

For example:
```
Hello, this is a test 123.
```

### 2. Run the encryption file first

This makes sense since you first want to encrypt the text and at a later time decrypt it.

Run it by typing the full path of the script in the console.

For example:
```
c:\scripts\Selfmade\Base64\ent.ps1
```
Make sure that the correct file is specified in the path!

### 3. Run the encryption script

If you want to decrypt the encrypted text, tun the encryption script.

Run it by typing the full path of the script in the console.

For example:
```
c:\scripts\Selfmade\Base64\ver.ps1
```
Make sure that the correct file is specified in the path!
